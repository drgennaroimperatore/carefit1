<h3>Stage 2 Page 3: Muscle and Balance</h3>
<h4>What are muscle and balance exercises</h4>
<p>Muscle strength and the ability to balance are the building blocks that make up our physical function- they are important throughout life. As we age, it becomes increasingly important to maintain muscle strength and balance to stay independent, flexible and feel strong and healthy.</p>
<p>Muscle strength: What many people don’t realise is that good physical function requires working all the major muscle groups to strengthen the muscles. Muscles don’t work alone- they are often working together with your bones to give you strength and the good news is that impact activities also strengthen bone health (we’ll come to these definitions later!). This becomes more important as we age when muscle and bone density start to decrease.</p>
<p>Balance training is slightly different from muscle exercises. Whatever your age, good balance helps you control your body’s movement whether it be your reaction time to stay on your feet on an icy morning or you are simply strengthening your joints for day to day life and preventing sprains and strains.</p>
<p><b>Examples of strength and balance activities include:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Arm raises (upper body)</li>
    <li>Leg squats (Lower body)</li>
    <li>Standing on one leg (balance</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Muscle and balance is important</b>

<ul>
    <li>Muscle and balance activities help us develop strength and build healthy bones during childhood and young adulthood. </li>
    <li>As we reach adulthood it help us to maintain strength and as we reach midlife and beyond it delays the natural decline in muscle mass and bone density which occurs</li>
    <li>In later years muscle and balance can help us maintain function and prevent falls, slips and strains</li>
</ul>
