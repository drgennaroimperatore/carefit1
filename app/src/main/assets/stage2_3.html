<h1>2: Activity types</h1>
<h2>Muscle and Balance</h2>
<h2>What are muscle and balance exercises</h2>
<p>Muscle strength and the ability to balance are the building blocks that make up our physical
    function. Balance training is slightly different from muscle exercises. Whatever your age,
    good balance helps you to control your body’s movement. This could mean improving your reaction
    time to stay on your feet on an icy morning or simply strengthening your joints for day to day
    life.</p>

<p class="runon">What many people don’t realise is that good physical function requires working all the major
    muscle groups to strengthen the muscles. Muscles don’t work alone- they are often working
    together with your bones to give you strength and the good news is that impact activities
    also strengthen bone health. This becomes more important as we age when muscle and bone
    density start to decrease. Examples of muscle strength and balance activities include:

<p class="runon">Muscle and balance is important to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>develop strength and build healthy bones during childhood and young adulthood.</li>
    <li>delay natural decline in muscle mass and bone density which occurs with age.</li>
    <li>maintain function and prevent falls, slips and strains (in later years).</li>
</ul>
