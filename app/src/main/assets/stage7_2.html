    CareFit is designed for empowering you to improve your own physical health. Some techniques you might already be aware of can have a profound impact on your overall physical and mental health wellbeing.
</p>

<p>
    One of these is mindfulness, where regular practice has been associated with a wide number of benefits,
    including reducing worry, negative thoughts and helping us to ’be’ in the present. It can also be
    used to reconnect, helping us to becoming more aware, more in tune with our bodies in the present
    moment. If you would like to learn more see <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mindfulness/">this NHS page</a>

<p>
    Long term, the impact of mindfulness reaches over to our physical wellness. Long term studies of regular mindfulness have shown fundamental changes in brain structure and have been associated with improvements in chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety and chronic pain. Therefore, we have added this section to our CareFit app as an optional extra- a tool that is here for you whenever you need it. It is an activity you may enjoy doing either from time to time, or as a regular habit.
