<h1>4: Managing time</h1>
<h2>What do I need to know?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Caregiving is a massive achievement in itself and it can be extremely busy - there are over 6 million carers in the UK alone!
    </li>
    <li>CareFit is an app designed to recognise this, and our activities developed can be done in 5 minutes or less
    </li>
    <li>It might be that you have to think quite creatively about how to find the time- it could even be when the kettle is boiling!
    </li>
    <li>"Active living" is something that is important to remember - you are likely to be keeping fit already by some things you are
        already doing - and you can record it on CareFit.
    </li>
    <li>All of the activities on CareFit can be done from home and do not need specialised equipment.
    </li>
</ol>
