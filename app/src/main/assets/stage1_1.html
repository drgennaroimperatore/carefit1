    The CareFit app is designed for unpaid caregivers (family or friends of someone who needs regular assistance) who have either started:
    <ul>
    <li>	thinking about doing more physical activity or; </li>
    <li>have started doing more physical activity (and would like to do some more).</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
    Spending time looking after others means that many caregivers don’t have time free to care for themselves.  If this pattern continues, carer health can decline. High blood pressure, anxiety, stress and poor sleep are common in carer communities. These are not just problems in the short term, in the long term there is a higher risk of falling ill - including catching infections.

    Regular physical activity can do a lot to help you as a carer stay well. It can improve physical fitness, reduce sedentary time, lift mood and prevent new health problems from arising. While knowing this is helpful, it’s not always enough- lots of people would like to know more details about making physical activity a habit but don’t always know where to start.
