<h2>Welcome and Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome and congratulations on downloading the CareFit app!
</p>
<p>
    The CareFit app is designed for unpaid caregivers (family or friends of someone who needs regular assistance) who have either started:
    <ul>
    <li>	thinking about doing more physical activity or; </li>
    <li>have started doing more physical activity (and would like to do some more).</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
    Spending time looking after others means that many caregivers don’t have time free to care for themselves.  If this pattern continues, carer health can decline. High blood pressure, anxiety, stress and poor sleep are common in carer communities. These are not just problems in the short term, in the long term there is a higher risk of falling ill - including catching infections.

</p>

<p>
    Regular physical activity can do a lot to help you as a carer stay well. It can improve physical fitness, reduce sedentary time, lift mood and prevent new health problems from arising. While knowing this is helpful, it’s not always enough- lots of people would like to know more details about making physical activity a habit but don’t always know where to start.

</p>

<p>
    This CareFit app is designed to support carers plan and carry out practical, safe, and fun exercises at home. It is designed to help you know what types of things you can do, when you can do it and how much is enough.
</p>

<p>
    The format of this educational section is to take you through a logical step by step process and allows you to focus on your personal needs and physical activity plans. We strongly suggest that you use the first seven days to spend 5 to 10 minutes each day to learn about physical activity and make a personalised plan.  This ensures that you will develop plans that are safe, effective and are personalised- it also helps you to form longer term habits.

</p>

<p>
    While we recommend you complete the educational sections in full, If you wish to, you can skip to:
    -	Review current activities and make your weekly plan
    -	Try out a physical activity
    -	Test your knowledge on physical activity
