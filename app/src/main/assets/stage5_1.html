<h1>5: Goal Setting and Weekly Planner</h1>

<p>
    It doesn’t matter where you are starting from using the CareFit app. Some activity is better than nothing, and more is better still. Without judgement, think about where you are just now in terms of your physical activity goals by looking at the responses to your initial activity questionnaire.

    Where would you like to be within the weeks ahead? The next thing we will ask you to do is to develop your weekly planner.  A few things to bear in mind before you do are:
</p>

<div class="box">
<ul>
    <li>Plan and set your goals for the next two weeks across the three different groups of activities; (i) sedentary breakers, (ii) cardiovascular activities and (iii) muscle and balance.
    </li>
    <li>Try not to do too much too soon.
    </li>
    <li>Aim to make small increases between each week.
    </li>
    <li>You can choose from activities within the app or you can define your own.
    </li>
    <li>It is personal to you.
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>
        Something is better than nothing and more is better still
    </p>
