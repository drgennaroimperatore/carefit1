    How do your activities compare with the UK guidelines? Maybe they are close or far apart- it doesn’t really matter and there is no need to worry. Did you know that 8/10 people in the UK think that they are fit, while only 3 out of 10 do enough to keep their heart healthy?

    The most important thing to keep in mind is something is better than nothing.  The CareFit app will provide you with support and advice on how to increase your physical activity and move towards the national recommendations, step by step, day by day.
