<h2>Planning Ahead for Relapse

    What are the things that can stop you achieving your own physical activity goals? And if these happen, what prevention or recovery strategies might you use to recover from these relapses? In this task-  we will develop a list of triggers that could cause a relapse in my physical activity and strategies that I can use to overcome them.
