<h3>What is Sedentary Behaviour?</h3>
<p>
    Sedentary behaviour involves sitting or lying down, (with the exception of sleeping). You can be sedentary at work, at home, when travelling or during leisure time.
</p>

<p>
    Examples of sedentary behaviour include:
    <li>Sitting or lying down while watching television.</li>
    <li>Sitting while driving a vehicle, or while travelling.</li>
    <li>Sitting or lying down to read, study, write, or work at a desk or computer.</li>
</p>

<h3>Sedentary behaviour is important</h3>
<p>
Being sedentary for prolonged periods (over 30 minutes) can have a negative impact on our health. In the short term, sedentary behaviour can make us feel sluggish and tired. In the longer term sedentary behaviour can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.
</p>
<p>
What’s remarkable is that small changes to sedentary behaviour can make a big difference not just too how you feel in the short term, but also to your long term health and wellness. Sedentary behaviour can also be broken up by simple light intensity activities such as standing or chair-based exercises.

<h3><u>Within the CareFit app…</u> </h3>

<p>Take a moment and think about when you are sedentary most during the week. We have designed CareFit to help keep an eye on your own sedentary behaviour. You will be able to make plans to reduce your time spent sedentary- and you can make a target for reducing sedentary behaviour for as many days a week as you feel comfortable to.</p>

<p>We have also included a handy timer option on our main menu that you can start when you sit down to help you track your own progress or time your own sedentary “breakers”.</p>
