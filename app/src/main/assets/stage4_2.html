<h1>4: Managing time</h1>
<h2>A working example</h2>

<p>
    Jim is a caregiver living in Stirling who would like to do more physical activity.  To get there he is considering his current daily routine.
</p>

<p>
    He knows that he is already doing some activity already, and that there are points in the day where he can do some more. To help him plan his future activities he has listed the total number of minutes spent doing various activities each day
</p>

<p class="runon quote">
    On average each day, I am spending the following minutes on these activities in total:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Activity</th>
        <th>Minutes where I could do additional activity</th>
        <th>Activities I am already doing</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Making a cup of tea</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Watching TV</td>
        <td>12-</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Housework</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Walking the dog</td>
