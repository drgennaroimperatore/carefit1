<h1>4: Managing time</h1>

<p>
    Caregiving can be a busy life. Work, the school run, hospital visits, you name it- it can be a packed schedule, so finding time for regular physical activity can require a creative (!) outlook.
</p>

<p>
    It might be that you can manage 10 minutes at short notice here and there, or that you know there will be certain times of day when your schedule gives you a few minutes in front of the television. It might also be that you are already doing physical activity without thinking about it, as mentioned previously under “active living”.

    The good news is you don’t have to be surrounded by specialised gym equipment to get going. Simply having a few minutes while the kettle is boiling is a great chance to carry out some simple exercises. This module is for you to write down the activities that happen day to day that give you the best chance of reaching your goals.

    Within the app, instructed exercises take five minutes or less- this is a great starting point to build up your weekly activity. If you would like to do more than this- there are also options- for example you can repeat an activity or develop your own.
