<h1>2: Physical Activity</h1>
<h2>How much am I doing?</h2>

<p>
    To succeed with any behavioural change, it’s helpful to think where you are starting from so that your goals are both achievable and meet your needs. This activity is designed to help you review your present physical activity levels over the last 7 days. By recording this information, you will be able to track your progress over the next few weeks and make achievable plans that can work best for you.
