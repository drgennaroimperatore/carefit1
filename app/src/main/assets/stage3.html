<h1>3: Relationships and Physical Activity</h1>
<h2>What do I need to know?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Relationships are a really important part of physical activity plans- both the way you feel and the support you may have from others.
    </li>
    <li>Many carers find that plans work well when they have had time to weigh up the benefits (pros) vs. the cons (barriers) to physical activity.
    </li>
    <li>Most carers will have a number of different barriers to face that are personal to them.
    </li>
    <li>Taking time to think of ways to address barriers to physical activity has been shown to be beneficial to those starting out in physical activity.
    </li>
    <li>Overcoming barriers is personal, you might be able to handle it on your own or you might need help from family or friends.
    </li>
</ol>
