<h1>Stage 7:  The mind and body
</h1>
<h2>What do I need to know?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>There is a strong connection between the mind and body- physical activity is associated with a number of positive mental benefits.</li>
    <li>Because this connection is so strong, the mind plays an important role in our motivation and interest in physical activity- sometimes it can feel like it is working against us!</li>
    <li>It is extremely important to be kind to yourself throughout your physical activity journey- something is better than nothing.
    </li>
    <li>It’s ok not to achieve your goals every day.
    </li>
    <li>Many people find that meditation and mindfulness is helpful to overall wellbeing so we have included an example here for you to try.
    </li>
