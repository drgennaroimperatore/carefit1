<h1> 6:  Physical Activity and consequences</h1>
<h2>Relapse Prevention
</h2>

<p>
    On the road to most great achievements, it is important to know that there can be set-backs along the way. Caring tasks could have taken longer than expected, there can be lots of valid reasons why it’s difficult to stick to a prepared plan every day- it can be easy to become judgemental on ourselves.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes it doesn’t make any difference if plans change- you end up doing an activity at a later time on the same day or another day to your original plans but you have still achieved your weekly goals. Sometimes however, any of us can end up falling behind on our goals without being able to catch up again.
</p>

<p>
    The good news is that there are tools you can use to get yourself back on track. Carers who have previously attained behavioural changes in physical activity have suggested the following prevention and recovery strategies.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Stick reminders in key places (refrigerator, computer) to remind you to do activity or ask a friend to send email or phone reminders.
        </td>
        <td>One lapse does not mean failure, or that you have to wait to the next day or week to get back on track. Resume your day as if you had not had the lapse.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>If you feel tired all the time think of the active living idea. Remember also that the level of effort required to get health benefits is not too hard.
            </td>
        <td>Replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Rather than feeling discouraged, guilty and angry, remind yourself of how much you have achieved so far.
        </td>
    </tr>
