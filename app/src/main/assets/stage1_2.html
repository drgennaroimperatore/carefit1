<h2>Stage 1 Page 2: Changing behaviours- one day at a time</h2>

<h3>Trans Theoretical Model of Behaviour Change</h3>

<p>
    The app is grounded in psychology techniques including the “TransTheoretical” Model.
    This model recognises that people are at different stages in their readiness to be physical active.
    The transtheoretical model comprises of five stages of change which are illustrated below.
    At any point in time you as a carer will fall into one of these stages in relation to your present physical activity. The aim of this app is to help you identify ways to become more active, move through the stages of change and prevent relapse by taking it one day at a time.
