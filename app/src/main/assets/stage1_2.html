<h1>App Overview</h1>

    The format of this educational section is to take you through a logical step by step process
    and allows you to focus on your personal needs and physical activity plans.  It complements
    the activities we have developed both in text and video.
</p>


<p class="box">
    We strongly suggest that you use the first seven days to spend 5 to 10 minutes each day
    to learn about physical activity and make a personalised plan. 
    This ensures that you will develop plans that are safe, effective and are personalised -
    this gives you the best chance of forming longer term habits.
