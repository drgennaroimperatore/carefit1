<h1>5: Goal Setting and Weekly Planner</h1>
<h2>Weekly Planner Development
</h2>

<p class="runon">To make your weekly plan we are going to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Summarise your weekly goals overall
    </li>
    <li>Develop more detailed plans for activity week 1
    </li>
    <li>Develop more detailed plans for activity week 2
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing your weekly goals
</h2>
<p>Not sure where to begin?  You can refer back to activities you are doing on a daily basis. 
</p>
<p>In the first part of the planner we are going to plan ahead for activity weeks 1 and 2.
    What do you think is realistic within week 1 and what can you comfortably increase for week 2?
</p>
