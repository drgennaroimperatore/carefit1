    <tr class="noborder">
        <td class="noborder"><img src="7_confident.png" class="fullwidth"><br>
            Are not very confident doing exercise, or comfortable with their body;
        </td>
        <td class="noborder"><img src="7-sporty.png" class="fullwidth"><br>
            Don’t feel sporty enough and wish things could be a certain way.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Be kind to yourself</b> around physical activity and your progress.
        </li>
        <li>It’s ok not achieve your goals every day- doing something is always better than nothing.
        </li>
        <li>It’s not unusual for people to relapse, if this happens, try not to be disheartened.
        </li>
        <li>It’s ok to slow down or take a break.
        </li>
        <li>Remember that you are not alone- there are millions of carers around the world who are in similar situations to you.
        </li>
